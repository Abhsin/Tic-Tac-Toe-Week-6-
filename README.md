# Tic-Tac-Toe Week 6 
Tic Tac Toe architecture:
cli.py: This is the file that contains the Command Line Interface (CLI) for the tic-tac-toe game. This file dictates the inputs and outputs of the game.
logic.py: This is the file that contains the core logic for the tic-tac-toe game. These functions should be imported to the cli.py to implement the game logic.
tests.py: This is the file that contains the unit tests for the logic of the game. All the functions written in the logic.py should be tested here. A starter test is given for your reference. While writing the tests is assigned for Assignment 8, you can work on them now if you have interest.
logs/: Add a folder(s) to capture game logs and document in the relevant code where logging will occur. This will set up for the next assignment in capturing data for later analysis
Add a license
Tic Tac Toe required functionalities:
The players are initialized with an empty board. 
The two players should be able to input their moves into the Python CLI by taking turns.
When there is a viable winner, the game ends and the winner is announced. 
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until either of the players wins or when it is a draw.
Homework Tasks:
1. Move the logic portion of your assignment 5 work into the logic.py file to make the architecture better
2. Put `logic.py` and `test.py` in your repository
3. Create the /logs directory
4. Find a license online that is appropriate and add it to the repository
5. Check that you can manually play the game correctly, with 2 'players', considering different tests or game scenarios
